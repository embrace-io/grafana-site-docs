# Embrace Docs for Grafana


Welcome!

This repository serves as a source for Embrace expertise to be hosted on the Grafana documentation site. It contains the code for a static documentation section in Grafana.

This repo is a clone of the [Grafana Writers Toolkit](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit), which allows you to run this content in the UI paradigm of Grafana's documentation site. The only changes are within the [sources](/writers-toolkit/docs/sources) folder, which is where the content and assets for these pages live. 

Presently, we are unsure where this content will ultimately live. Feel free to make a suggestion!

## Work in development

To see the documentation in your browser:
- Open Docker
- Navigate to `/writers-toolkit/docs/`  
- Run `make docs PROJECT=writers-toolkit`
- View documentation root at `http://localhost:3002/docs/writers-toolkit/`

## Ways to contribute

You can contribute content in the following ways:

- Make a pull request
- Submit an issue
