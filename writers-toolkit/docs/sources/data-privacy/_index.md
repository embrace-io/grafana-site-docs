## Privacy considerations

### App developer information

Embrace collects personally identifiable information from developers, such as your name and email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us. We also track the views and actions you take in our dashboard in order to improve the service.

### End user session information

We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications (“End Users”) published by our customers. By default, such information is only linked to a session but not linked to any personally identifiable information, such as a persistent device identifier or email.

However, it’s possible that your application might collect personally identifiable information unintentionally. Therefore, in instrumenting your applications, consider what user information you capture and store in Embrace.

### End user personal information

Our customers may optionally request personal information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications. Such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us and linked with end user session information. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.
