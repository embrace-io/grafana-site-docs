# Embrace dashboard insights

Embrace's mobile telemetry collection and aggregation are all reflected in helpful features in the Embrace dashboard. The high-cardinality data captured by our backend allows you to drill down to the issues in individual user experiences, or measure the efficacy of your latest version at a scale of millions.

In the Embrace dashboard, you can:
- sift through [user session timeline](./user-session-insights/) to find out exactly when something went wrong for a particular user.
- evaluate the performance of important user flows using [performance tracing](./performance-tracing/).
- assess the high-level functioning of your application across a variety of dimensions using [synthesized metrics](./dashboard-metrics/).

## Troubleshooting

If you have questions, you can ask them in the [Embrace Community Slack](https://community.embrace.io).
