# Mobile signals

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}'s Mobile Observability SDKs capture vital performance and user information.

{{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} models the user's interactions with your app in the form of [sessions](./sessions/). A combination of [automatic and manual instrumentation](./instrumentation/) allows you to capture the most important aspects of the user session.

When your mobile app is linked to {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}}, all the telemetry is processed and aggregated into meaningful, actionable information with our [Dashboard Insights](./../insights/). You can also export the raw traces and logs from the Android and Apple SDKs directly to Grafana using [OpenTelemetry](./opentelemetry-signals/), with OTel support for other platforms upcoming.
