# Get started with Embrace

Getting started with {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} is easy. This guide includes everything you need to get {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} into your mobile application, and to begin to see telemetry in your {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} dashboard.

There are three steps to adding {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} to your mobile app:

1. [Create an {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} account, if you haven't already, and log in](./create-account/).
1. [Configure a new app in the {{< param "PRODUCT_NAME" >}} dashboard](./configure-app-in-embrace/).
1. [Set up the relevant mobile SDK in your mobile application](./add-embrace-in-your-application/). Embrace can be integrated into Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, and Unity apps.


## Troubleshooting

If you have questions, you can ask them in the [Embrace Community Slack](https://community.embrace.io).
